# Auto07p

[AUTO](http://cmvl.cs.concordia.ca/auto/) is a versatile continuation package for solving boundary-value problems written by [Eusebius Doedel](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~doedel/) and his collaborators.

* News: [Auto07p](https://github.com/auto-07p/) is on Github. [Version 0.9.3](https://github.com/auto-07p/auto-07p/releases/tag/v0.9.3) released in Aug 2021 supports Python 3.
* Installation: Please refer to the [installation instructions for auto07p](auto07p_installation_guide.md) for my notes on installing AUTO.
* Documentation: Two files explaining the format of the auto07p output and its equations files are posted in the folder [auto07p_documentation](auto07p_documentation/).

## Auto07p tutorial for the computation of spatial patterns

This tutorial provides an introduction to computing spatial patterns using auto07p. The tutorial was developed by [David Lloyd](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/david-lloyd) and [Bjorn Sandstede](http://bjornsandstede.com) for the mini-course _Using AUTO for Stability Problems_, which ran as part of the workshop [Stability of coherent structures and patterns](http://depts.washington.edu/bdecon/workshop2012/) that was held during 11-12 June 2012 at the University of Washington in Seattle.

## HomCont

HomCont, developed by [Alan Champneys](http://www.enm.bris.ac.uk/anm/staff/arc.html) (University of Bristol), [Yuri A Kuznetsov](http://www.math.uu.nl/people/kuznet) (Utrecht University), and [Bjorn Sandstede](http://bjornsandstede.com) (Brown University), is a numerical toolbox for homoclinic bifurcation analysis designed for use with AUTO. HomCont deals with continuation of codimension-one heteroclinic and homoclinic orbits to hyperbolic and saddle-node equilibria, including the detection of many codimension-two singularities and the continuation of these singularities in three or more parameters. HomCont has been incorporated into AUTO and [XPP](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html).
